#+SEQ_TODO: TODO TEST DONE

* TODO Make agent autonomous
** DONE Implement fork module
** DONE Implement join module

* TODO Create the environment based on FIFA
** TODO Message Transport
** TEST Agent Directory
*** DONE Implement Socket program in common lisp
    - sb-socket (sample program found)
    - sb-sys has this implementation for doing handler function for
      functions and x11. Use it for the agent.
*** DONE Implement sha1 key generation in common lisp
    - used cffi to link to the libssl
    - this knowledge can be use for VRJuggler bindings.
*** TEST Implement a hash table (a distributed hash table would be good)
    - 
** TODO Service Directory
** TODO ACL (Agent Communication Language)


notes:

* An agent-environment frame work to build distributed applications.
* Each agent has a unique identity in a given env.
* The id of the agent is given by
  - (root
     abstract0-env      India
     wan-env            com 
     lan-env            lite3d
     abstract0-env      Visualization-team
     system-env         newton
     proceess/port-env  3000
     parent-agent       vrX-window-manager
     child-agent        window0
     grand-child-agent  viewport0(left-eye))
* The environment is a system (engineering level) entity. [network-os-process etc] 
* The agent is an abstract entity (scientific-mathematical level).
* An agent can live free in the environment and not bother about the underlying implementation.
  - Agent should be able to migrate to another environemnt if it feels so.
  - Should not loose its communication and links with other agents in
    the process.
* The environment on the other hand has to adapt to the agent.
  - Env has to make sure that the agent can do computation using all
    the resources when availble
* The agents identity is associated with its environment.
  - Therefore when an agent migrates then its identity changes.
  - A change in identity implies that the agent has to inform everyone
    associated with the agent about this change.
  - Alternatively the env can adjust its database automatically to
    accomodate for the migration. (This seems like a better idea)
  - In this scenario the agent just needs to know the name of the
    other agent. However the environment has to maintain the location
    of the other agent.

* Agent has different contexts.
